In the image below, the convolutional layers are named by stack and their order in the stack. Conv_1_1 is the first convolutional layer that an image is passed through, in the first stack. Conv_2_1 is the first convolutional layer in the *second* stack. The deepest convolutional layer in the network is conv_5_4.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/raw/master/style-transfer/notebook_ims/vgg19_convlayers.png\" width=80% />\n\n### Separating Style and Content\n\nStyle transfer relies on separating the content and style of an image. Given one content image and one style image, we aim to create a new, _target_ image which should contain our desired content and style components:\n* objects and their arrangement are similar to that of the **content image**\n* style, colors, and textures are similar to that of the **style image**\n\nAn example is shown below, where the content image is of a cat, and the style image is of [Hokusai's Great Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa). The generated target image still contains the cat but is stylized with the waves, blue and beige colors, and block print textures of the style image!\n\n<img src='https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/raw/master/style-transfer/notebook_ims/style_tx_cat.png' width=80% />"},{"metadata":{"id":"oVlHGJYMbP5N","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7b1206e82683c9b6d0f269971def5655c3a1f7d8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import resources\n%matplotlib inline\n\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport torch\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torchvision import transforms, models","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"7d0XIknPbP5Z","colab_type":"text","_uuid":"d879940d5cb2711463b02eb363ed70bf0a0e15ef"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load in VGG19 (features)\n\nVGG19 is split into two portions:\n* `vgg19.features`, which are all the convolutional and pooling layers\n* `vgg19.classifier`, which are the three linear, classifier layers at the end\n\nWe only need the `features` portion, which we're going to load in and \"freeze\" the weights of, below."},{"metadata":{"id":"jVr5_jzvbP5c","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f7710325ec38cfb299bfe8307ed5d87beaeedecc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# get the \"features\" portion of VGG19 (we will not need the \"classifier\" portion)\nvgg = models.vgg19(pretrained=True).features\n\n# freeze all VGG parameters since we're only optimizing the target image\nfor param in vgg.parameters():\n    param.requires_grad_(False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"jfKwUYt0bP6F","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":726},"outputId":"84b031fd-5406-4ec9-d766-9c73803cf7bd","trusted":true,"_uuid":"56714eecb4da53210dffc55d4aa1f7217512846d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# move the model to GPU, if available\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n\nvgg.to(device)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"d4VsYd9bbP6n","colab_type":"text","_uuid":"2add82f05bc066531e1cc3d7af8015bdbf006867"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Load in Content and Style Images\n\nYou can load in any images you want!

Therefore, the number of steps is really up to you to set! **I recommend using at least 2000 steps for good results.** But, you may want to start out with fewer steps if you are just testing out different weight values or experimenting with different images.\n\nInside the iteration loop, you'll calculate the content and style losses and update your target image, accordingly.\n\n#### Content Loss\n\nThe content loss will be the mean squared difference between the target and content features at layer `conv4_2`. This can be calculated as follows: \n```\ncontent_loss = torch.mean((target_features['conv4_2'] - content_features['conv4_2'])**2)\n```\n\n#### Style Loss\n\nThe style loss is calculated in a similar way, only you have to iterate through a number of layers, specified by name in our dictionary `style_weights`. \n> You'll calculate the gram matrix for the target image, `target_gram` and style image `style_gram` at each of these layers and compare those gram matrices, calculating the `layer_style_loss`. \n> Later, you'll see that this value is normalized by the size of the layer.\n\n#### Total Loss\n\nFinally, you'll create the total loss by adding up the style and content losses and weighting them with your specified alpha and beta!\n\nIntermittently, we'll print out this loss; don't be alarmed if the loss is very large. It takes some time for an image's style to change and you should focus on the appearance of your target image rather than any loss value.
